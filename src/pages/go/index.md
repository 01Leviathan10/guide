## Go

**Go** (or **golang**) is a programming language created at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a compiled, statically-typed language in the tradition of Algol and C. It has garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features, and CSP-style concurrent programming features added. The compiler and other language tools originally developed by Google are all free and open source. Its popularity is increasing fast. It is a great choice for building web applications.
