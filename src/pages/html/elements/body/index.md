<p>The  &lt;body&gt; tag contains the content for a webpage. Along with &lt;head&gt;, it is one of the two required elements of an HTML document. &lt;body&gt; must be the second child of an &lt;html&gt; element. There can only be one &lt;body&gt; element on a page. 

The &lt;body&gt; element should contain all of a page's content, including all display elements. The &lt;body&gt; element can also contain &lt;script&gt; tags, generally scripts that must be run after a page's content has been loaded.

  <body>
