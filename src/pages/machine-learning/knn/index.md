## k Nearest Neigbors (kNN)
kNN can be used either in a classification or a regression problem. In classification, the output of kNN is a class membership. For example, if an object is surrounded by apples, it's more likely to be an apple than orange. When used in regression, kNN finds k number of the most similar items to an object and assume that the value of that object will be roughly the same as items nearest to it. For example, a 2-year-old Toyota car with a mileage of 450 miles is going to have a price more similar to that of a 2.5-year-old Toyota car with 400 miles, than to that of a 5-year-old Toyota with a mileage of 1000 miles.
