## Comments in CSS

Comments are used in CSS to explain a block of code or to make temporary changes during development. The commented code doesn't execute. A comment in CSS can be both single line or multi-line.

``` css
    /*
        This is
        a multi-line
        comment
    */
    /* This is a single line comment*/
    .group:after {
        content: "";
        display: table;
        clear: both;
    }
```

We can add as many comments to our stylesheet as we like, and itâ€™s good practice to use CSS comments to help identify parts of any stylesheet that might be difficult to understand from a cursory glance. By using CSS comments to make our stylesheets more readable, the CSS will be easier to maintain in the future.
