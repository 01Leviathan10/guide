# Closures

A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.



### Example

```js
//we have an outer function named walk and an inner function named fly

function walk (){
  
  var dist = '1780 feet';
  
  function fly(){
    console.log('At '+dist);
  }
  
  return fly;
}

var flyFunc = walk(); //calling walk returns the fly function which is being assigned to flyFunc
//you would expect that once the walk function above is run
//you would think that JavaScript has gotten rid of the 'dist' var

flyFunc(); //Logs out 'At 1780 feet'
//but you still can use the function as above 
//this is the power of closures

```
### Another Example
```js
function by(propName) {
    return function(a, b) {
        return a[propName] - b[propName];
    }
}

const person1 = {name: 'joe', height: 72};
const person2 = {name: 'rob', height: 70};
const person3 = {name: 'nicholas', height: 66};

const arr_ = [person1, person2, person3];

const arr_sorted = arr_.sort(by('height')); // [ { name: 'nicholas', height: 66 }, { name: 'rob', height: 70 },{ name: 'joe', height: 72 } ]

```

The closure 'remembers' the environment in which it was created.
