Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format README files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.  You can write Markdown in your text editor too like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code.
