## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) 

<p>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates the basic tools developers need to write and test software. IDEs are designed to encompass all programming tasks in one application. </p>
<p>Therefore, IDEs offer a central interface featuring all the tools a developer needs, including the following: a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, a debugger and build automation tools (these tools automate common developer tasks.) that the developer accesses through a single graphical user interface (GUI).The IDE may be a stand-alone application or may be included as part of one or more compatible applications.</p>
