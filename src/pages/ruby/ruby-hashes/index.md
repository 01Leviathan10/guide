## Ruby Hashes

A hash is a collection of keys and values. It is similar to what is commonly called a dictionary in other languages.

There are a few different ways to create a new hash:
```ruby
hash1 = {a: 100, b: "200"}
hash2 = Hash.new
```

You can access the different values by looking up a key:
```ruby
my_hash[:a] # 100
```
