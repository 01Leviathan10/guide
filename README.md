# freeCodeCamp Guides

## Contributions

`npm run dev` and open `localhost:8000/docs` (we are working to remove the `docs` dir #4 )

New guides should be created with the format of:

`[section]/[page-url-slug]/index.md`

If in doubt, see other guides in the `pages/docs` directory

Once a new guide has been added, `Ctrl + C` in the terminal and `npm run dev` again. This will rebuild a config file that `gatsby` uses to serve the pages.

Many thanks
